# Feature Specification: han-solo - Agentic Orchestrator for Modern Software Delivery

**Feature Branch**: `001-spec-md`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "# **Architecting han-solo: An Agentic Orchestrator for Modern Software Delivery**"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a software developer using Claude Code, I want an orchestrator tool that enforces opinionated best practices and automates my Git workflow, so that I can maintain consistent code quality and linear project history without manual effort.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new repository, **When** I run the initialization command, **Then** the system sets up standard configuration files (.gitignore, .gitconfig, .gitmessage, PR templates) and configures branch protection rules
2. **Given** I am on the main branch, **When** I start a new feature, **Then** the system creates a new feature branch from the latest version of main
3. **Given** I have made code changes, **When** I attempt to commit, **Then** the system automatically runs linters and formatters before allowing the commit
4. **Given** a completed feature branch, **When** I ship the feature, **Then** the system creates a pull request with generated descriptions from the code changes
5. **Given** I am on a feature branch, **When** I attempt to push to main directly, **Then** the system blocks the operation and requires a pull request

### Edge Cases
- What happens when linting fails during pre-commit checks?
- How does system handle merge conflicts during rebase operations?
- What occurs when attempting to create a branch from an outdated local main?
- How does system respond when GitHub API limits are exceeded?
- What happens if CI/CD pipeline configuration detection fails?
- How does system handle JSON mode when commands invoke other commands?
- What happens when ASCII banner display exceeds terminal width?
- How does system maintain squadron identity across command chains?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide initialization capability for new repositories with opinionated configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce linear Git history through automated rebasing
- **FR-003**: System MUST run quality checks (linting, formatting) before allowing commits
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent direct pushes to protected branches (main/master)
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate pull request descriptions from code differences
- **FR-006**: System MUST create feature branches from the latest remote main branch
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide conflict resolution guidance during rebase operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST auto-detect project type for CI/CD pipeline configuration
- **FR-009**: System MUST display real-time workflow status information
- **FR-010**: System MUST support both command-based and natural language interactions
- **FR-011**: System MUST create atomic commits from multiple checkpoint changes
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide different interaction modes (verbose for learning, terse for experts)
- **FR-013**: System MUST integrate with GitHub for repository configuration
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain checkpoint history during development sessions
- **FR-015**: System MUST squash checkpoint commits into single atomic commits when tasks complete
- **FR-016**: System MUST support squadron-themed command interactions with quotes and ASCII banners
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide JSON communication protocol for command chaining and agent responses
- **FR-018**: System MUST prevent banner truncation when commands invoke other commands

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Repository Configuration**: Standard files and settings that define project structure and workflow rules
- **Feature Branch**: Development branch created from main for isolated work
- **Checkpoint Commit**: Temporary granular commits created during development
- **Atomic Commit**: Final squashed commit representing complete task
- **Pull Request**: Code review request with auto-generated descriptions
- **Workflow Status**: Real-time information about current branch, PR state, and CI/CD checks
- **Quality Checks**: Linting and formatting validation results
- **Conflict Resolution**: Merge conflict detection and resolution proposals
- **Squadron Response**: Structured JSON communication between commands and agents with squadron identity
- **Banner Configuration**: ASCII art banners and squadron quotes for themed command interactions
